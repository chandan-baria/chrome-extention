# chrome-extention
This extension is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To achieve the summarization functionality, developed a Summarizer API in Python. When the user clicks the "Summarize" button, it triggers a call to the Summarizer API, which then processes the request and returns the summarized text. The Chrome extension then displays the summarized content.
